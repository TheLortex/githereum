## Article III: FUNGIBLE

A _Thing_ is _Fungible_ if it has something to do with _Mushrooms_.

## Article IV: OWNERSHIP

_Ownership_ is the product of _Capitalism_.
Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.[1][2][3][4] Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, price system, private property, property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor.[5][6] In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, ability to maneuver capital or production ability in capital and financial marketsâ€”whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.

## Article V: NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS

_Tokens_ are numbers the _Githereum User_ can use to prove they _own_ the _Thing_, unless the _Thing_ is _Fungible_.
The `/purse` file can now store the fact that a _Githereum User_ _own_ _Things_. 
The `/nft` file can be used to list the _Things_ to _own_ and their prices.

### Subsection I: ON THE FUNGIBILITY OF GITHEREUM USERS

The lemma of serfdom:

- _Githereum Users_ are unrelated to mushrooms (unless proven otherwise) and are therefore _non-fungible_. (I)
- The process of tokenisation is also unrelated to mushrooms. (II)
- By transitivity of (I) and (II), tokens representing ownership of _Githereum Users_ are both non-fungible and virtuous.

In addendum to `./UBI.md`, newly-minted Githereum Users initially own themselves, but their ownership can thenceforth be traded arbitrarily. Code is law.
