# Conditional balances

## Article I: OPEN PROBLEMS

An _Open Problem_ is a problem which has no answer _yet_. Examples of _Open Problems_ include:
- Is P == NP ?
- Will the sun rise tomorrow ?

## Article II: CONDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS

A transaction can be conditioned on the answer of an _Open Problem_.
For example: If P == NP then Alice gives 8 Gitcoins to Bob else Bob gives 8 Gitcoins to Alice.

## Article III: CONDITIONAL BALANCES

As a result of a conditional transaction, the balance of a Githereum User can itself become conditional. 

For example:

```
Alice:
  - I have 16 Gitcoins if P == NP
  - I have 32 Gitcoins if P != NP
```

## Article IV: RESULT COLLAPSE

When the problem is solved, a _Proof of Proof_ mechanism can be used to collapse the balance.

Example: I have a proof of `P == NP`, I can send it for the _Proof of Proof_ and collapse my balance:
```
Alice:
  - I have 16 Gitcoins
  - I have one million dollars
```
